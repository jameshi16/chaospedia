# Chaospedia

## What is a Chaospedia?

Chaospedia is a term I coined to describe a space where I dump information without worrying about writing them in structure. Chaospedia is currently an experimental concept, which means that I can change how it looks, works, and the technologies it uses. At the moment, I am using [https://gitbook.com](https://gitbook.com).

The main website is over at [https://codingindex.xyz](https://codingindex.xyz), and all the blog itself is open-source and available to anyone who visits the  website's repository @ [https://github.com/jameshi16/personal-website](https://github.com/jameshi16/personal-website). The main website has a strict, self-imposed, no JavaScript policy, so it can be viewed from almost any circumstance  or situation.

Chaospedia \(Gitbook-hosted\) uses some JavaScript, **although I do have some plans to make a non-JavaScript version** by dual-hosting Chaospedia on GitHub pages. I'll update my blog whenever that happens.
