# ➡️ Chaospedia

## What is a Chaospedia?

Chaospedia is a term I coined to describe a space where I dump information without worrying about writing them for other human beings to understand. At the moment, Chaospedia is an experimental concept, which means that I can change how it looks, works, the technologies it uses, and its existence at all. Chaospedia is currently hosted on [https://gitbook.com](https://gitbook.com).

The main website (blog) is over at [https://codingindex.xyz](https://codingindex.xyz), and all the content in the blog is open-source and available to anyone who visits the  website's repository @ [https://github.com/jameshi16/personal-website](https://github.com/jameshi16/personal-website). The main website has a strict, self-imposed, _no JavaScript policy_, so it can be viewed from almost any circumstances, including for the privacy-paranoid.

Chaospedia (Gitbook-hosted) uses some JavaScript, **although I do have some plans to make a non-JavaScript version** by dual-hosting Chaospedia on GitHub pages. I'll update my blog whenever that happens. At the moment, unfortunately, the JavaScript imposed by Gitbook includes:

* Google Analytics (albiet without an Analytics ID, because I haven't and refuse to make one)
* Polyfills from `polyfill.io`
* An unknown logger technology that didn't load under uBlock Origin

The hope for Chaospedia is to serve as a information dump for stuff that don't make it into a blog post, and as supplementary material for projects I publish on the internet; things such as API documentation may either have their own Gitbook wiki, or reside within a page in Chaospedia.
