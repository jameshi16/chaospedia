# 🍎 (in-progress) XCode LSP with Emacs

* Use xcodebuild to list schemes
* Use xcode-build-server config to configure a buildServer.json
* The lsp-sourcekit package will be able to handle all languages from then on
* REQUIRES a build from XCode (very annoying): Product > Build For > Running
  * Based on the source codes ([https://github.com/SolaWing/xcode-build-server/blob/master/server.py](https://github.com/SolaWing/xcode-build-server/blob/master/server.py) and [https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/blob/main/Sources/SKCore/BuildServerBuildSystem.swift#L181](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/blob/main/Sources/SKCore/BuildServerBuildSystem.swift#L181)), there are three important things that need to exist:
    * indexDatabasePath: Typically in \`\~/Library/Caches/xcode-build-server/-Users-name-path-to-project/indexDatabasePath-\*\`
    * indexStorePath: Typically in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ProjectName-hashlike/Index.noindex/DataStore`
    * compile\_file: Typically called `~/Library/Caches/xcode-build-server/-Users-name-path-to-project/compile_file-ProjectName-md5Hash`
* For god knows what reason, when you do `xcodebuild -workspace ... -scheme ...`, you only get `indexDatabasePath` and `indexStorePath`. compile\_file can only be generated by xcode (the app)
  * There's probably a root cause for this, but I can't be bothered
* So, for a project to be successfully, fully indexed, you need to build at least once in xcode (the app). This is a problem if you're trying to bypass signing with CODE\_SIGN\_IDENTITY="" CODE\_SIGNING\_REQUIRED=NO CODE\_SIGN\_ENTITLEMENTS="" CODE\_SIGNING\_ALLOWED=""



TODO: Put the other commands here
